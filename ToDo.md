# West Wind WebSurge ToDo List
This document describes various fixes, ideas for new features and various 
work items. 

### Priority List

* **Review and Update Documentation**  
Documentation is for v1, so all screenshots need to be updated and behavior changes. It'll require a complete revamping of the docs.


### Core Features

* **Save and Load From Gist (or other global store)**  
Allow saving or loading from Gist.


### Miscellaneous Fixes required

### Features
  
* **Sync multiple WebSurge Instances to increase load**   
Allow multiple instances of WebSurge on multiple machines run the same
test and synchronize their results. One machine acts as a master the
others as slaves controlled by master.
